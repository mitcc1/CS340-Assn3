Written in C++ using Visual Studio 2017

Assignment Description:
Choose one to implement
a. heapsort
b. mergesort
c. quicksort
The list of items to be sorted cannot be hard coded.
It can be done in any programming language of your choosing.
Create one repository for the sorting algorithm on GitHub. Besides the coding files,
the repository must contain:
i. a READ.me file with proper instructions on how to run it
ii. either a script/log text file or a video of your algorithm running.

Solution Description:
I chose to implement mergesort. My program takes a list of integers from the user then calls the split function.  The split function divides the list recursively until it can't be divided anymore.  Once the list is divided, the mergesort function is called and the divided lists are merged back together in sorted order.  The sorted list is output to the screen. 

User Instructions: 
1. Run the program
2. Enter the number of items you want to sort and press enter. 
3. Enter the items to be sorted and press enter
